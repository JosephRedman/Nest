# Nest
Nest is a custom programming language / REPL written in python but will be eventually be available in EXE form.
Nest is made with simplicity in mind and readability paramount so simple functions are used, for instance in the REPL, to easilly output a variable set, you just enter `getvar x` where x is the variable you need to know's value.
Nest has been designed to be similar to python without acctually being pyton itself (even though it is written in it!). Unless you are a variable, the language is NOT case-sensitive for ease of use.


## Currently Implemented:

placeholders:

x = variable, y = value

---

`help` - shows the user a list of "commands" they can type in the REPL, will be replaced to a link here.

`getvar x` - "gets" a variable and outputs it's value to the console.

`setvar x y` - "sets" a variable to a certain value.

`output x` - Outputs a variable to the console.

`exit` - closes the REPL.

### Acknowledgements

This code was fully written my me, Joseph, in my spare time, so errors and features may take time to be implemented. Thanks for understanding!

Thanks to @kolihinokami and @octacore4f on discord for suggestions in the James Sharman's Discord server for this language!
